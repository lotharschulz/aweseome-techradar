> A curated list of Tech Radars

[Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar) is initiated by [thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com).

Tech Radar is all about tracking interesting things, which is referred to as blips. Blips are organised onto the Radar using two categorizing elements: the quadrants and the rings. The quadrants represent different kinds of blips. The rings indicate what stage in the adoption lifecycle we think they should be in.

Organisations can build their own tech radars: [Build your own Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/byor).
